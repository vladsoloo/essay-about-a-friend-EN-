###  an Essay about a friend

Hello! I want to tell you about my friend. His name is Yaroslav. He is 17 years old. He has blond hair and blue eyes. His height is 177. We have been friends since the 2nd class. Yaroslav and I met through my classmate. He loves riding an quadbuike very much. I ride with him quite often, because thanks to him, I bought my first motorcycle. He has a lot of equipment in the garage. Motorcycles, quadbikes and even tricycles. Yaroslav always repairs the equipment himself if it is broken. and if he doesn't succeed, I always help him. Also on his direction. I really like being friends with Yaroslav because we have a lot in common and we are always ready to help each other!
